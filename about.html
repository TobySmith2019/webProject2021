            <p>Welcome to Cucullo, your number one source for all things shirt and hoodie related. We're dedicated to giving you the very best products, with a focus on dependability, customer service and uniqueness. Founded in 2004 by George Smith, Cucullo has come a long way from its beginnings in a classroom in Southland, New Zealand. When George first started out, his passion for helping other parents be more eco-friendly, providing the best equipment for his fellow societal members, drove him to action, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the world at very low prices, and are thrilled to be a part of the eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the fashion industry.</p>

            <p>We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
